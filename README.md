# Filtering-Spam-Email-Messages-Using-Naive-Bayes-Algorithm
This project is a machine learningâ€“based spam detector that classifies emails as either spam or not spam. The model is built using Python and leverages natural language processing techniques such as text cleaning, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization to transform raw email messages into numerical features. After preprocessing, the dataset is split into training and testing sets, and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is trained to learn patterns associated with spam emails. The performance of the model is then evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to measure its effectiveness. Additionally, the project includes data visualization with word clouds and plots to provide insights into common words in spam versus non-spam messages.
